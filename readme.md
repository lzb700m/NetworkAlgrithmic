#Algorithms for Network Planning

This repository contains source code for 3 projects related to network planning:

- Project 1 (networkCapacityPlanning): utilizes Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm to optimized a network capacity planning given network flow requirements. Several experiments are carried out in order to compare the result given different network topology. Result is also visualized using Java Universal Network/Graph Framework (JUNG2).
- Project 2 (networkConnectivity): this is a study and implementation of Maximum-Adjacency Ordering and Nagamochi-Ibaraki algorithm used for network connectivity calculation.
- Project 2(networkReliability): this is a study and implementation of network reliability given network topology using exhaustive enumeration.

All 3 projects are implemented in Java, and are organized in packages. To test the program:

	go the subfolder of the project source code
	java ./src/[sub folder name]/project*.java
	java ./bin/[sub folder name]/project*
from the command line.

Study report is also included in the repository, it is in the ./report folder.
